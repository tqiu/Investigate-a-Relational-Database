# Investigate a movie rental database

## Description
* In this project, I use SQL to explore a relational database related to movie rentals.
* I wrote SQL code to answer interesting questions about the database.
* Some questions are:
    - What are the percentages of movies in the 4th quartile of rental durations for each family movie category?
    - Of the top 10 paying customers, which customer paid the most difference between two successive months during the year?
